### About Me
I have been working in IT for more than 20 years. The last 10 years

reporting solutions. The previous years developing Client/Server and mobile applications.

In 2022  I had the chance to learn two Cloud technologies,
AWS and Azure, and newer Data Engineering architectures, tools and methodologies.

I am interested in Data Engineering/Analytics and Cloud Engineering.

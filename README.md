### About Me
I have been working in IT for more than 20 years. The last 10 years
mainly everything related to the development and maintenance of
reporting solutions. The previous years developing Client/Server and mobile applications.

In 2022  I had the chance to learn two Cloud technologies,
AWS and Azure, and newer Data Engineering architectures, tools and methodologies.

I am interested in developing in Cloud Data Engineering/Analytics roles.
